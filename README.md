# P.A.N. License
The PAN License (short for Piero's Anti-NFT License) is a semi-restrictive license in the terms of using code within or to generate NFT(s). 

While this license can be used by anyone without restriction, the license itself cannot be changed without permission from Piero Maddaleni (piero@piemadd.com), unless the name is changed to something other than `PAN`, `P.A.N.`, `Piero's Anti-NFT`, and `Piero's Anti NFT`. If you wish to reccomend a change, please create a PR or Issue on Github.
